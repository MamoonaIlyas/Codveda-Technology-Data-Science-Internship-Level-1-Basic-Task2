Description: Clean and preprocess a raw dataset to  make it suitable for analysis
ðŸ§¹ Project Title: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Description:

This project is part of Level 1 - Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Codveda Technologies. The objective of this task was to clean and preprocess a raw dataset to prepare it for further data analysis and machine learning tasks.

The following preprocessing steps were applied to the Boston Housing dataset:

ðŸ”¹ Missing Data Handling: Checked for and imputed any missing values using mean imputation.
ðŸ”¹ Outlier Detection and Removal: Applied the IQR method to detect and remove outliers.
ðŸ”¹ Categorical Encoding: Converted categorical variables into numeric form using both Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
ðŸ”¹ Feature Scaling: Performed both Normalization (Min-Max Scaling) and Standardization (Z-score Scaling) for numerical features.

This task demonstrates key preprocessing techniques essential for any data-driven project and ensures the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis or modeling.
